The Atomic game for Windows

Made by Tom Halvorsrød, Oslo, Norway, 2003.

Pure entertainment, and a little chemistry on the sly. 
Use C, V and the arrows to move the atoms to form a 
molecule according to the solution. Idea and graphics 
"stolen" shamelessly from the Katomic for Linux, by A. Wurst.
